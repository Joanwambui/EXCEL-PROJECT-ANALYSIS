# EXCEL-PROJECT-ANALYSIS
An excel project to check on the purchases of bicycles.The following steps were taken to complete the project.
1.)Cleaning the dataset-Involved removing duplicated values,changing some column acronyms with other variable names that would be easily understood,converting the cost column to currency, Add an age bracket column using an If statement from the age variables
2.)Use a pivot table to display some of the  insights regarding the purchase of bikes,they included visualizing according to average salary for the gender to determine who purchased bicycles more than their counterpart,age against our target variable was also an interesting visualization.
3.)Finally we created our very own dashboard from Excel using all the information we got from the pivot tables.
